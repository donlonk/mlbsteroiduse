    "Based on the KMeans clustering using PCA, it is a safe assumption to say that there were a good amount of players using steroids between 1994 and 2004 that did not get caught. In 2005, there were 111 players who were suspended for using performance enhancing drugs, not all of them steroids, there is a wide range of drug use that was anything from amphetamines to muscle building supplements being used. Of these 111 players, 52 percent of them were pitchers. This accounts for about 58 players out of 111, leaving 53 hitters who were suspended for using steroids. If we take the 7 percent increase in players performing above average during the steroid era, out of the 2154 players, that is about 151 players total who could have been using performance enhancing drugs. If only 53 hitters were suspended, and give or take another 10 who later admitted to using, that leaves 88 players that had a significant performance jump during the steroid era. This is not saying all of these players were using steroids, but it could be a valid assumption that there were that many more using steroids.\n",

    "So to answer the initial question:\n",
    "\n",
    "During the steroid era, were there a significant number of players using steroids? Is it possible to tell how many were?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is impossible to really know, and it is not fair to accuse any players of using steroids. But it is hard to ignore that there was potentially 7 percent of the league using them, but like I said before, this was a time when technology was also taking off, bats were getting better, training programs were getting better, and players were getting strong. So these players who account for the increase that weren't using steroids could easily be explained. But I don't think it is a coincidence that there were that many more players performing extremely well. Even if a quarter of those 88 players that had a performance jump were using steroids, that is still 22 more players than were suspended, which I would consider significant, it is almost 50 percent of the number of players suspended.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final answer is, yes, there were a significant number of players using steroids, and yes it is possible to tell how many more there were. \n"
