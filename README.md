Exploring steroid use among hitters from 1984 to 2014

By Kevin Donlon

I wanted to explore the steroid era of baseball to determine if there was a significant amount more players who were using steroids than were actually caught.

I explored each time peroid around the steroid era, 10 years before the steroid era (1984 - 1993), 11 years during the steroid era (1994 to 2004), and 10 years after the steroid era (2005 - 2014).

The analysis notebook has a detailed explanation of each era and the things I was looking at to make determinations.
